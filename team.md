### Contributions

1. **Created the Java Template for the Project**
   - Developed the initial Java template (HW 1) that set the groundwork for further development, including the setup of the Maven build configuration.

2. **Implemented Main Functionalities**
   - **Gitignore Rules & Parser**: Designed and implemented the logic for parsing `.gitignore` files and applying the rules to file paths within the specified directory structure.
   - **File Walker**: Developed the file system walker that recursively traverses the directory tree, applying `.gitignore` rules to determine which files should be ignored based on the specified criteria.

3. **Testing**
   - Developed comprehensive JUnit tests for both the `.gitignore` rules logic and the parser component, ensuring that all functionalities meet the expected standards and behave correctly across various scenarios.

4. **Documentation**
   - Authored the `README.md` file, providing a detailed description of the project, its usage, features, and setup instructions, thereby facilitating ease of use and understanding for new contributors and users.

### Contributions

1. **Upgraded Testing Framework**
   - Upgraded to JUnit 5 and integrated Mockito for enhanced unit and integration testing, improving test coverage and robustness.

2. **Enhanced CLI Argument Handling and JAR Execution**
   - **CLI Argument Processing**: Refined the command-line interface in the Main class to handle input parameters more efficiently, allowing for better automation and usage flexibility.
   - **JAR Execution Fixes**: Addressed and resolved the "no main manifest attribute" error by adjusting the Maven Shade Plugin configuration, ensuring that the JAR is executable with all necessary dependencies properly embedded.

3. **Expanded Test Coverage**
   - Developed comprehensive tests for FileSystemWalker and FileMatcher, significantly improving code coverage across core functionalities.

4. **Improved Project Configuration and Maintenance**
   - **Gitignore and POM File Updates** : Updated .gitignore to exclude system files and resolved Maven POM issues to enhance compatibility and maintainability.
   - **Error Handling and Logging Improvements**: Enhanced error handling and logging mechanisms across multiple classes, improving the applicationâ€™s stability and providing clearer runtime information.

6. **Documentation and Quality Assurance**
   - Enhanced project documentation and participated in code reviews to ensure high-quality code standards and maintainability.
